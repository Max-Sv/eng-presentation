          <p class="feat-title">What Went Right?</p>
          <p class="feat-text">
            Netflix is by far not a case about luck, right place, or time. This
            is a case about hard work, risks, creativity, and planning. They
            have built a strategy that made them №1 at the streaming market.
            Let’s see why their approach was so successful.
          </p>
          <p class="feat-title">Personalize</p>
          <p class="feat-text">
            Personalization is the principle concept that Netflix follows in its
            product development and even company building. They make users feel
            like everything is done for them and fits perfectly like a tailored
            suit or dress. Netflix engages in customer science to make sure they
            deliver content that will satisfy users’ needs to make them come
            back.
          </p>
          <p class="feat-title">Appreciate What You Have</p>
          <p class="feat-text">
            The decision that became a success factor for the company was to
            develop a product for the existing users and consider their
            preferences. Not only this increased customer retention rates, but
            it also attracted new clients that wanted to get quality content.
          </p>
          <p class="feat-title">Create MVP</p>
          <p class="feat-text">
            Product development is not an hour time road; it will take a little
            longer. But the important thing is that while driving, you have to
            stop and ask your early customers if you are driving the right way.
          </p>
          <p class="feat-title">Create Your Ecosystem</p>
          <p class="feat-text">
            Netflix became the first online streaming platform that launched its
            own branded series. The main reason why “The House of Cards” became
            so popular is the ability of the Netflix team to analyze. Ask
            yourself what your customers like and make it better!

              Netflix and shop: Online store offers limited-edition merchandise
            </p>
            <p class="feat-text">
              Netflix will launch an online store to sell limited-edition
              apparel, lifestyle merchandise and collectibles based on “Stranger
              Things,” “Lupin” and other popular shows, the streaming giant said
              on Thursday.
            </p>
            <p class="feat-text">
              Netflix.shop will be available in the United States starting on
              Thursday and expand to other countries in the coming months,
              Netflix said in a blog post.
            </p>
            <p class="feat-text">
              The online store offers a new source of revenue for Netflix and
              expands its product line beyond the items it sells through
              partenrs such as Target Inc and Walmart Inc.
            </p>
            <p class="feat-text">
              In the future, the company plans to introduce products based on
              hit series "The Witcher" and "Stranger Things" and Netflix
              logo-wear from Japanese fashion house BEAMS.
